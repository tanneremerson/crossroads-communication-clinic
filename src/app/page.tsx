              Since first learning about stuttering, I have had a deep interest in working with
              people who stutter. I had the privilege of earning my Masterâ€™s degree at the
              University of Texas, Austin. There, I was fortunate to train at the Arthur M. Blank
              Center for Stuttering Education and Research, learning to implement their cutting edge
              C.A.R.E. model. I have worked with children as young as two, all the way through to
              adults in their golden years.
              <br />
              <br />
              Research shows us that stuttering occurs due to differences in brain structure and
              function (Chang, 2013,) and that the most impactful way for people who stutter to
              effect long-term change is to develop strong communication skills, resiliency,
              self-advocacy, and self-compassion.
